# Tailored

This project consists of two front-end clients: one for customers and volunteers (built with Angular) and one for admin and sellers (built with JSF).

On the JSF platform - it is a one-stop shop for artists to sell their artworks and self-care items or pre-curated self-care boxes.

On the Angular platform - we offer a safe community centered around mental health and wellness. Users can post their own mental health journey, read others with similar experiences and volunteers can also post resources to help those who are still struggling. This site is integrated with an e-commerce complete with checkout to allow users to shop artworks and self-care items posted by sellers. In addition, they can also built their own mental wellness box based on their own interests. :)
